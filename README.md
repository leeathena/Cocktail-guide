# Cocktail-Guide

Some bartending guides cover the whole world of cocktails, while others zoom in on one particular spirit, style, or other theme. Both can be great, depending on what you're looking for. 

We created our Library to encompass anything from combining whiskey and cola to fruit and spice infusions. Use our site as a resource or purely inspiriational and dream about the drinks within. Not all the drinks are alcholic. Lemons and limes are a must-have, both for juice and as garnish, as is sugar (preferably in the form of simple syrup) and club soda. Fresh herbs like mint are nice for muddling, and other fruits and juices are an easy way to add new flavors to traditional cocktails. 

## Features

- **Search Cocktails:** Easily search for your favorite cocktails by name.
- **View Drink Details:** Get detailed information about each cocktail, including ingredients and instructions.
- **Pick a random recipe** When you are out of ideas just click on our button at the bottom of our page and surprise yourself with an excellent recipe choice.


# <a name='Description'></a>Description
This is a web application that allows users to search for cocktail recipes and explore their ingredients.

The cocktail project features an on-net database that contains cocktail information which can be integrated into applications, software, and websites. We used a JSON API to get a vast array of cocktail recipes. A personal key or application was required to access this API. A html file and CSS script was coded to best showcase our skills.
